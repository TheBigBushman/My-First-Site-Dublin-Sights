Dublin Sights - Read Me

This site is based on the Love Running Module of our course in the CSS module.

The Aim for me was to be able to replicate mostly from memory and/or research to be able to somewhat replicate the crisp clean design.

Some of my main challenges around other test sites have been around responsive design which I feel I have rectified in this output.

It is a simple, informative 3 page site. The content is copy and paste from google searches but the flow and layout were the main point of focus. 

That along with use of imagery and links to resources.

First Test Project.
