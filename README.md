Dublin Sights - Read Me

This site is based on the Love Running Module of our course in the CSS module.

The Aim for me was to be able to replicate mostly from memory and/or research to be able to somewhat replicate the crisp clean design.

Some of my main challenges around other test sites have been around responsive design which I feel I have rectified in this output.

First Test Project.
